# Orbitale
Calculate and plot the orbitals of hydrogen. 

The three initial variables must be set to the desired orbital. 

g is the edge length of the examined cube.
f is only relevant, to determine the accuracy of the probability. Each axis is divided into f parts. 
To adjust the value of p, the factor for iso must be changed. It determines, which values of the probability-density will be included. Just play around with the factor, until p is about 0.9 or 0.95, or however you define the orbital.
